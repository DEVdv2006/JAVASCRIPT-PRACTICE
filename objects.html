//MORE ABOUT OBJECTS
//1) String also have properties and values
//2) in JS there is something known as AUTO-BOXING which wraps string 
//into a special object that has properties which can be used on string
//3)AUTO-BOXING DOESN'T WORK WITH NULL AND UNDEFINED
//4)Objects are Refrences
//5)we can create refrence to object
//6)We can't direcectly compare any two objects
const obj1={message:'hello'};
const obj2=obj1; //it will work as second name to obj1
obj2.message ='Good Job';
const obj3={message:'Good Job'};
console.log(obj1);
console.log(obj2);
console.log('hello'.length); //will print length of string
console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); //will print string in uppercase
console.log((obj3===obj1));//it will compare the refrences not the actual value inside it
console.log(obj1===obj2);//since both refrences have same memory address it will print true
const obj4={message:'Well Done',
             price:799  };
//const message=obj4.message; both this and below line work same
const {message,price}=obj4; //this is known as Destructring:-it is easier way to take property
console.log(message,price);  //out of object

const obj5={
   // message:message //it will assign value of messge variable this is known as
  message ,           //Shorthand Method
 /*method:function func1(){
    console.log('method');
 }*/
 method()
 { console.log('method');}           
        
};     
console.log(obj5);
obj5.method();
